About
=====

Welcome to the BIO120: Integrative and Experimental Microbiology website! 

You are reading the spring quarter 2025 edition.

In this laboratory course, we explore the fascinating world of microbial cells and phages through the lenses of experiments and theory. Experiments include quantification of microbial growth and phage infection dynamics, as well as homologous overexpression and molecular structure investigations of proteins. Methods include classical plating and plaque assays, plasmid engineering, protein extraction, and mass-spec analysis. "Dry labs" accompany bench work to promote data analysis and further explore the link between molecular processes and microbial phenotypes.


A more detailed overview of course content and syllabus is provided on this website.
