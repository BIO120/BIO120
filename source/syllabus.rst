Syllabus
--------

Outline
=======
To survive, grow, and reproduce, organisms coordinate different molecular processes so they can use available resources and cope with environmental conditions. This laboratory course explores molecular and cellular integration in bacteria. Experiments include the quantification of growth, homologous over expression of proteins, and genetic and growth control of phases and bacteria.These "wet lab" approaches will be combined with "dry lab" approaches to analyze experimental findings and explore further the link between molecular processes and cell physiology.


Prerequisite
==============
MATH 51 or MATH 19, 20,21. Required: BIO82, BIO83; at least one BIO lab course BIO 45, 46, or 47.  Strongly recommended: BIO 86.  Enrollment via application.


Canvas
==============
Assignments and announcements will be on Canvas and in some cases, announcements will be sent by e-mail.  Please check your e-mail regularly! 

Equipment
============================
We will handle and analyze data using the Python-based coding notebook Jupyter. Please bring a laptop (preferable) or tablet to class. 

Course outline
==============

- Weeks 1-5: Quantifying and analyzing bacterial growth in different media and cell behavior/response to phage challenge.
- Weeks 6-8: Plasmid engineering / homologous overexpression of lipoprotein Spycatcher003 in Gram-negative bacteria.
- Week 9: Student teams will design and carry out an experiment of their choice. On Tuesday June 4, teams make a short presentation on their findings.
