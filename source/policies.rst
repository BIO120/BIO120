Course Policies
----------------

Please consider the official syllabus for final details.  

Assignment
==============
Assignments include pre-lab and post-lab assignments. In general, assignments will be due the following week on Monday. Some assignments will be due the following day to facility the analysis of experimental data during the next class (shorter assignmants which typically include the transfer of data into a computer readable file).


Enrollment
==============
With seats (and bench space) being limited, preference is given to students strictly fulfilling all course requirements. To enroll via Canvas, you thus need a permission number from the instructors.


Absence and Make-up policy
============================
Students with planned or unplanned absences must email all instructors. Excused absences include illness and travel for official Stanford activities (such as a research retreat or varsity sports team competition).  Students with an excused absence will qualify for attendance points. The points for assigned work can be earned by a make-up activity (in lab or virtual, depending on the lab content that day).  Absences for social reasons or family travel do not qualify to get attendance points. However, points for the assigned work can still be earned by a make up activity.  
Example: Say that a Friday class (worth 1 attendance point) includes an in-lab exercise worth up to 4 points.  If someone misses that Friday class because of a family event, they will not get the 1 point for attendance, but they can still earn up to 4 points for doing the work carried out in class that day.


Masking & Social Distancing
=============================
Face coverings are no longer mandatory in classrooms but some people may choose to mask. 


Students with documented disabilities
=======================================
Students who may need academic accommodations should initiate a request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE) (https://oae.stanford.edu/). Professional staff staff will work to evaluate the request, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter.  This letter should be emailed to all instructors. Once we receive your letter, we will work with you to find the best ways to support you.  
We will ask in advance if anyone has two-color or monochromatic vision, and we will adjust the colors used in presentations to make sure they are distinguishable.
