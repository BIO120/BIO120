Grading
==============
Grading: Grading will be based on a point system. In total, 250 points can be obtained, 25 per week. Each week, 5 points will be given for class attendance and arrival on time (2 points per lab and 1 point for the discussion class). 20 further points will be given each week for assignments and participation. The assignments are posted via Canvas with the points for each assignment stated. There is a 10% penalty per day for late submissions. There are no tests.

Absence and Make-up policy
============================
Students with planned or unplanned absences should email all instructors. 

Masking & Social Distancing
=============================
Face coverings are no longer mandatory in classrooms but some people may choose to mask. 

Students with documented disabilities
=======================================
Students who may need academic accommodations should initiate a request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE) (https://oae.stanford.edu/). Professional staff staff will work to evaluate the request, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter.  This letter should be emailed to all instructors. Once we receive your letter, we will work with you to find the best ways to support you.
